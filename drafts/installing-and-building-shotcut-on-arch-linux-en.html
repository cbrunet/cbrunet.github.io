    <h1>Choosing the right&nbsp;software</h1>
<p>I recently needed a video editing software, for a little project. 
Therefore, I looked at what was currently available on the Linux world.
I quickly eliminated <em>DaVinci Resolve</em> and <em>Lightworks</em>, because they are
proprietary softwares, limited in their free version. I don&#8217;t want to
be limited in features, and I don&#8217;t like installing a closed source software on
Linux. I saw many comments telling that <em>Blender</em> was the best open source
option on Linux. But using a 3D modeler for video editing sounds odd to me,
and my experience with Blender is that it has a steep learning curve. I
wanted something more&nbsp;conventional.</p>
<p><em>OpenShot</em> was appealing, because it is written in Python.
But it seemed a little slow on my old computer.
And the interface seems a little too simplist for me.
For instance, when you insert text, you need to choose a predefined text layouts,
where you can adjuste the text itself and the color.
In fact, you can customize it further, but you need to use a svg editor like InkScape.
The software seems a very simple facade, but includes some very technical details,
in the properties window for instance. What I definitively like is
the possibility to add transitions between two different video tracks.
I still keep an eye on this software, but it is devinitively not my first choice for&nbsp;now.</p>
<p>I also gave a quick try to <em>Kdenlive</em>, but I definitively found the interface too bloated.
I doesn&#8217;t allow in-track transitions: you always need to perform transitions between
two different&nbsp;tracks.</p>
<p>I successfully created some videos using <em>Shotcut</em>. 
It seemed more stable and faster than other video editors, and it has all the basic
features I needed. However, it is still in active development, and some features are missing
(like the ability to change the track&nbsp;order).</p>
<h1>Installation on Arch&nbsp;Linux</h1>
<p>An up-to-date package is available: <a href="https://www.archlinux.org/packages/community/x86_64/shotcut/">shotcut</a>.
It is based on Qt, and on the <span class="caps">MLT</span> framework (in fact, the Shotcut developer is one of the <span class="caps">MLT</span>&nbsp;developers).</p>
<p>The software is translated in many languages. I was surprised to see that some translations were missing for very
basic commands (like Undo / Redo), until I realised I needed the
<a href="https://www.archlinux.org/packages/extra/any/qt5-translations/">qt5-translations</a>&nbsp;package.</p>
<p>I also realized many filters were missing. Digging further, I found that the missing filters
were all the filters based on the <em>webvfx</em> library. Unfortunately, this lib was not available on Arch Linux.
Therefore, I packaged it on <span class="caps">AUR</span>: <a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/webvfx/">webvfx</a>.
I also <a href="https://bugs.archlinux.org/task/66654">filled a bug</a>
to the shotcut package maintainer on Arch, to see if he would include it in the&nbsp;future.</p>
<h1>Building from&nbsp;source</h1>
<p>Buiding from sources is not complicated, since all needed dependencies were already installed
by the shotcut package. The Arch package has one patch, to replace the <em>qmelt</em> executable by
the <em>melt</em> executable. <em>melt</em> is a command line tool to interface the <em><span class="caps">MLT</span></em> library. It is
included in the <em>mlt</em> package. <em>qmelt</em> is a simple Qt wrapper for <em>melt</em>. As I understand,
it is needed on Mac <span class="caps">OS</span> and on Windows, but not on Linux. <em>qmelt</em> is provided by <em>webvfx</em>.
This is why it is not there with the original shotcut&nbsp;package.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$ git clone https://github.com/mltframework/shotcut.git
$ <span class="nb">cd</span> shotcut
$ mkdir build
$ <span class="nb">cd</span> build
$ qmake ..
$ make
</code></pre></div>

<p>The <span class="caps">README</span> file says the simplest way to run the compiled version is to directly
call <code>./src/shotcut</code>. However, I realised I first needed to symlink the qml&nbsp;files:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$ <span class="nb">cd</span> share/shotcut
$ ln -s ../../../src/qml
$ <span class="nb">cd</span> -
$ ./src/shotcut
</code></pre></div>
