title: Choosing a Static Site Generator
status: draft


# reStructuredText vs Markdown

At first, it wasn't clear to me whether I should write the articles using the rst or the md syntax.
I did not find any good advices on the topic when I searched the web.
I though that since rst was native to Pelican, while md needs another package,
rst should be the best choice. Isn't it the syntax used by Sphinx? And it can easily be
customized, while md need extensions to do similar things.

However, I didn't wrote a complete article before I realised that rst syntax was cumbersome
compared to md. For instance, I cannot have two links with the same name in rst. 
I quickly realized that it was faster and easier to write my articles using md than using rst.

But the good thing is that if I change my mind, or if I need to use rst for some reason one day,
Pelican can still handle it. Therefore, the choice is not a real one: I can use both!
